:: Failed to Enslave Eva[BadEnd]
Uh oh, you're screwed.  You can't get into the mall anymore, and there's no one to help you.  Without being able to get in, there's no way you'll be able to deal with whatever is happening in there.

Now that you think about it, Eva always seems to be hanging out at night around the mall... maybe she would have known of a way in.
