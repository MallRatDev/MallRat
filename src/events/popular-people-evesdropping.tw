		You know, sitting at a table listening to Bree and her little followers, you have an idea... if you could pretend that she was chubby, maybe by comparing her to Eva, might be able to trick her into trying on the collar...  Worth a thought.  When you can get the collar back, of course.  <br><br>[[West Food Court]]

<<else>>
	You take a seat and eavesdrop on the popular kids.  Bree is running on and on about her new diet while her sycophants praise her, telling her how thin and hot she is.  It goes on for almost half an hour.  Damn, the girl has some serious weight issues.<br><br>[[Enough of this.  Get up.|West Food Court]]
